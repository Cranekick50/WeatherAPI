# WeatherAPI

<body>

<p>The class was tasked with creating a webpage that was able to draw information from a Weather API to be presented as informative and useful.  </p>

<h3>How to Use It</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In the top left, type in the city of your choice.</li>
        <li>Click on the Search button. A button will generate with the city's name.</li>
        <li>The top will display today's weather information and below that will be the 5 day forecast.</li>
        <li>If you wish to revisit previous searches, simply click on the button generated from the previous search.
    </ol>

<h3>Features</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>When you search a city, the main body will feature the city name, date, temperature in fahrenheit, humidity, wind speed, and UV index.</li>
        <li>Also after a search, a 5 day forecast is listed.  This shows the date, temperature, and humidity.</li>
        <li>On both the main body and forecast, there is a different weather icon for the following weather types: "clear sky"-sun, "light rain"-sun and rain cloud, "moderate rain"-rain cloud, "overcast clouds" or "scattered clouds" - cloud.</li>
        <li>UV index of the main body, will turn red if it's above 6 and will turn green if it's below 6.</li>
        <li>Searching a city will generate a button, with the city name.</li>
        <li>Clicking a created button with the city name, will bring up the weather information for the city listed on the button.</li>
    </ul>
